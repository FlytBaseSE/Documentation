# Multi View Dashboard

## Overview

Built for enterprise-scale deployments, Fleet View 2.0 empowers you to execute fleet-wide commands and monitor multi-dock operations from a single control point, making it essential for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations and meeting regulatory compliance.

## Key Features:

* Unified Three-Panel Dashboard: Fleet View 2.0 integrates real time fleet monitoring, live video feeds, and interactive map visualizations in one centralized interface, enabling operators to monitor drone status, mission progress, and safety parameters across multiple dock operations simultaneously for comprehensive fleet oversight.
* Real-Time Fleet Monitoring: Color-coded device status indicators, comprehensive flight parameters, and detailed operational data including altitude tracking, mission status, system states, command execution progress, and health diagnostics provide instant visibility into every aspect of your operations.
* Fleet-Wide Batch Command Operations: Execute simultaneous commands across multiple selected drones with powerful batch controls including GTSA (Go To Safe Altitude), RTDS (Return to Docking Station), STOP commands, and Take Control functionality, transforming individual drone management into coordinated fleet operations.
* Visibility Customization: Control which drones appear in your active workspace using show/hide functionality and bulk visibility controls, allowing operators to focus on critical missions while maintaining awareness of the broader fleet status and reducing interface clutter.
* Priority Pinning System: Pin a specific drone for prioritized monitoring with automatic video feed highlighting, map tracking that follows drone movement, and persistent focus that ensures critical assets remain front and center throughout their missions.
* Device Health and Diagnostics Monitoring: Real-time health indicators with critical error reporting, diagnostic codes and warning systems for providing immediate visibility into device hardware.
* Weather Alerts and Airspace Threat Detection: Integrated monitoring system tracks both airspace threats and weather conditions with real-time alerts, detailed threat information including ICAO codes and altitude parameters, essential for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) compliance and operational safety.
* Command Status Tracking: Complete monitoring of command execution with real-time progress updates, success confirmation, failure alerts, and detailed historical records with timestamps.
