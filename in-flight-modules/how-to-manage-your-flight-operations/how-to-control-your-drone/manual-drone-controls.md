# Manual Drone Controls

This feature not only ensures that you have direct control over your drone's movements but also helps you navigate through complex environments or make on-the-fly adjustments. Manual Controls offer the precision and responsiveness you need during remote drone operations.&#x20;

## Types of Manual Controls

There are three methods available for operators to take manual control of the drone using the FlytBase dashboard:

1. On-screen Joypad
2. Keyboard and Mouse
3. Xbox 360 Joystick (Wired) or Thrustmaster (Model T.16000M FCS )

## Essential Settings for Manual Controls

Setting the Pitch, Roll, and Throttle speeds of the drone before engaging manual controls is crucial. For guidance on fine-tuning the key sensitivity (aircraft speed) for manual functions like Pitch, Roll, and Throttle, you may refer to the [Advance Drone Controls guide](../../../pre-flight-modules/platform-settings/preferences.md).

## Taking Drone Access Control

Before taking manual controls, ensure that you have access to control the drone. Refer to the following documentation to learn more on how to take '**Drone Access Control**' from other members within an organization.

## How to Activate Manual Controls?

1. During a mission, click on the 'Pause' button located on the drone control panel.&#x20;
2. To gain manual control of the drone, click the 'Manual control button' located on the drone control panel.

3. Next, a pop-up will appear, asking if you'd like to take manual control of the drone. Upon confirmation, the control of the drone is transferred to the remote drone operator for manual operations.

### Steps to use the 'On-screen Joypad' for Manual Controls

* The 'On-screen Joypad' is the default control mode when manual controls are activated.
* To operate the drone with the on-screen joypad, simply click on the relevant buttons, which follow the standard notation for Yaw, Throttle, Pitch, and Roll, similar to any drone remote controller set to mode 2.
