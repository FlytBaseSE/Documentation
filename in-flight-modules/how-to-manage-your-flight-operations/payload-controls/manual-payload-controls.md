# Manual Payload Controls

## Types of Manual Controls

There are two methods available for operators to take manual control of the drone's payload using the FlytBase dashboard:

1. Keyboard and Mouse
2. Xbox 360 Joystick (Wired) or Thrustmaster (Model T.16000M FCS )

## Essential Settings for Manual Controls

Setting the Pitch, Roll, and Throttle speeds of the drone before engaging manual controls is crucial. For guidance on fine-tuning the key sensitivity (aircraft speed) for manual functions like Pitch, Roll, and Throttle, you may refer to the [Advance Drone Controls guide](../../../pre-flight-modules/platform-settings/preferences.md).

## Taking Payload Access Control

Before taking manual controls, ensure that you have access to control the drone's payload. Refer to the following documentation to learn more on how to take '**Payload** **Access Control**' from other members within an organization.

## How to Activate Manual Payload Controls?

1. During a mission, click on the 'Pause' button located on the drone control panel.&#x20;
2. To gain manual control of the drone's payload, click the 'Manual control button' located on the drone control panel.

3. Next, a pop-up will appear, asking if you'd like to take manual control of the drone. Upon confirmation, the control of the drone is transferred to the remote drone operator for manual operations.
