# Guest Sharing with Maps

FlytBase enables efficient live drone video stream sharing with multiple remote users across different devices and networks. A vital benefit of this feature is enhanced collaboration, especially in critical operations like emergency response, where real-time visual and telemetry  data shared among teams can lead to faster and more effective decision-making.

## Generating a Sharing Link:

* Within the **Fleet** view, Click on the <img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/4Okm-Z84n1qVtLy0aNgXa-un0QQz53fTl_e2OgNJ-gtbIW-lggCWYPX9OpKerICLTdB0OfYqykRXgYhrbTOapv3l5nhyWCsXJ1mrUbmesZGfxGwXOSjWdhPn-L99lszey8KPT4PmRObRiOXVtv5YuqQ" alt="" data-size="line">button.
