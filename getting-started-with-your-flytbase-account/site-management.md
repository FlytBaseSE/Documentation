# Site Management

* A Site is a geo-location on the map.&#x20;
* You can assign devices, members, and missions to a Site. Operators will have selective access to these resources at each site location during drone operations.
* Each site serves as a centralized hub for operations, ensuring improved coordination and streamlined management of drone operations across various locations or teams.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Configuring a Site with the desired devices, missions, and members is a mandatory process for flight operations.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If any devices and missions existed before the creation of the default site (Site 01), they would be a part of it along with all the members added to the organization.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Navigating to Sites

* Navigate to the 'Sites' tab inside the 'Navigation Drawer'.

{% hint style="info" %}
You cannot delete the default site, as an organization must have at least one site to perform operations.
{% endhint %}

## Creating a New Site

* To create a new Site, click on the '<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png" alt="" data-size="line">' button.

* Refer to the following steps while creating a new 'Site':
  1. Assign a name for the Site.
  2. Left-click on a location on the map to mark the position of a site.
  3. Add registered devices that need to be assigned to the site. There is no limit to the number of devices that can be added to a site.\
     Note: Site members can only operate devices assigned to their particular site.
  4. Assign members to the particular site.\
     Note: Members in an organization can only perform operations on those sites they are part of.

{% hint style="success" %}
A 'Device' can only be added to a single site.
{% endhint %}

### Assigning Missions for a Site

* To assign missions to a particular site, refer to the following documentation:

{% content-ref url="../pre-flight-modules/planning/mission-planning/" %}
[mission-planning](../pre-flight-modules/planning/mission-planning/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Best Practices

* Create sites for different drone and dock fleets registered on the dashboard, where each setup is located at various locations.&#x20;
* Assign members to specific sites to ensure a seamless fleet management experience.
* Ensure that every new device has been assigned to a site.
