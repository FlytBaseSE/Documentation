# Creating a FlytBase Profile

## Operating System and Browser Requirements

The FlytBase Dashboard is optimized for desktop use and is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. You can access the Dashboard through popular web browsers. For the best experience, we recommend using the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox.

## Passwordless Signup and Login for FlytBase

FlytBase provides a passwordless signup and login experience. Users can create a profile with their email address and login using a **Magic Link** sent to their registered email. This method streamlines the process by eliminating password management while ensuring secure access to the Dashboard.

* Open a supported web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, or Firefox) and navigate to [console.flytbase.com](https://console.flytbase.com).
