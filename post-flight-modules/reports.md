# Reports

## Introduction

The Reports feature is designed to transform how enterprise drone teams log, review, and share critical observations. Whether you’re managing routine surveillance, infrastructure inspections, or rapid incident responses, this feature enables teams to generate structured Day/Night Shift Reports and Incident Reports based on drone flight logs and media, all from within the FlytBase dashboard.

This enhancement reduces manual documentation effort, empowers cross-team collaboration, and enhances post-flight analysis — particularly valuable in high-security sectors like energy, logistics, construction, and public safety.

## Creating a New Report

1. Log in to your FlytBase dashboard and open the **Navigation Drawer**. Select **Reports**.

2. Choose the type of report you would like to create and then click on the **Create Report** button.

* **Shift Report** – for routine Day/Night Shift reports
* **Incident Report** – for documenting specific incidents

{% hint style="info" %}
**Custom Date Range** is available for both Shift and Incident Reports. For simplicity, you may also choose **Day Shift** or **Night Shift** for any particular day. \
**Day Shift - 6 AM to 6 PM (0600 to 1800 hours)**\
**Night Shift - 6 PM to 6 AM (next day) (1800 to 0600 hours)**
{% endhint %}

3. In the **Report Details** section:

* Define the **time period** for analysis
* Add a **Description** for context and internal documentation

For each Report, you may add up to **4 Observations**, and **each Observation may have up to 10 media files** attached.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

6. **Review the report details:** Before finalizing, review the selected flights, observations, annotations, and attached media to ensure all critical information is accurately documented.&#x20;
