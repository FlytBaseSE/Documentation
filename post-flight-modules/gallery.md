# Gallery

## Accessing the Gallery

To access the Gallery from the FlytBase Dashboard:

1. Click on <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Hamburger Menu.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> to open the **Navigation Drawer**
2. Scroll down the list, and click on **Gallery**

## Gallery Layouts

In the **Gallery**, you can view media files in two distinct layouts:

* **Files (default)**: This layout displays all media files. The files are grouped by their unique Flight ID and sorted by the date they were captured. By default, the media is arranged in _reverse chronological order_, i.e., photos and videos from the latest flight are displayed first.
* **Folders**: This layout shows all folders, each corresponding to a unique Flight ID, and arranges them in a reverse chronological order.

## Managing Media

### Searching and Sorting

* **Search:** Use the search bar to locate specific media files or folders by **file name** or **flight ID**.
* **Sort Media:** Use the <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Sort.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button to sort media by date, from newest to oldest or vice versa.

### Filters

You can refine what you see in the Gallery using several filters:

* **Date:** Select a specific date or a date range.
* **Site:** Filter and show media files for selected Sites only.
* **Flight type:** Choose between automated missions or manual flights.
* **Mission:** View media related to specific missions.
* **Device:** Media files associated with a Device (Dock-Drone setup) can be viewed using this filter.
* **Camera:** This filter allows you to sort files by the camera used to capture them, which is particularly useful for drones equipped with swappable imaging payloads.
* **Media type:** Choose to view only images, videos, or panoramas.
* **Lens type:** Filter by lens type used to capture media, such as wide-angle, zoom, or thermal.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the **Folder** layout, the **Media type** and **Lens type** filters can be **applied within a selected folder**, while other filters are available to organize and sort the folders.
{% endhint %}

To clear all filters and revert to the default view, click on **Reset**.

### Media Interactions

* **Export or Delete:** Select media files or folders to export via email or delete them.
