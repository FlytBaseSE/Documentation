# Drone Control

For safe autonomous Dock-Drone operations, it is crucial to ensure the following:

* **Safe Take-off**: Drones must ascend to a safe altitude above the docking station before proceeding to their target waypoints.
* **Safe Return**: While returning, drones should fly at or above a safe altitude to avoid all obstacles and descend vertically over the dock.

To manage drone behavior during these operations, you can configure the following parameters:

* **Take-off Altitude**
* **Return to Docking Station (RTDS) Altitude**

**Accessing These Parameters**:

1. Navigate to **Device Management** and select the relevant device.
2. Go to **Settings** -> **Drone Control**.
3. Set the desired **RTDS Altitude**.
4. Enter the **Take-Off Altitude**.&#x20;
5. To revert to default values, click on **Reset**

These altitudes are set relative to the take-off point (Docking Station), and these ensure safety when the drone executes a pre-planned mission or a Go-to Location flight.
