# Device Settings

FlytBase allows for Device-specific settings, enabling customization for each Device. Key configurable options include:

* **Collision Avoidance Sensing (CAS) System**: You can turn the CAS system on or off for each device to enhance safety during operations in a cluttered environment.
* **Drone Control**: These altitude settings can be independently configured to ensure that drones safely take off and return to the docking station during fully autonomous missions.

To know more, go to the documentation for [Collision Avoidance Sensing](collision-avoidance-sensing-cas.md) and [Drone Control](drone-control.md) settings.
