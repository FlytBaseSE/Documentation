## **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**

As part of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), we highly recommend following these steps:

* **Pre-flight Check**: Before each flight, review the Diagnostics tab to ensure the airworthiness of both your dock and drone. Look for any warnings or critical issues that may affect the safety and performance of your equipment.
* **In-Flight Check**: During a flight, use the HMS overview widget in the drone details view for real-time warnings and errors, to ensure smooth flight operations and informed decisions.

* **Post-flight Check**: After every flight, revisit the Diagnostics tab to verify that no new issues have arisen during the flight operation. Identifying and addressing problems promptly can prevent future complications.

With the Diagnostics feature, you can proactively maintain the health and reliability of your equipment, ensuring safer and more efficient operations - knowing that you have real-time insights at your fingertips.

After setting up your devices, head to the Pre-Flight Modules to learn about [failsafes](../../../pre-flight-modules/learn-more-about-failsafes/), pre-flight checklists, configuring essential [settings](../../../pre-flight-modules/platform-settings/), and [planning your mission](../../../pre-flight-modules/planning/) for setting up your first flight.
