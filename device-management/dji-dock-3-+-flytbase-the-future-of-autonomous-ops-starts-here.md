# DJI Dock 3 + FlytBase – The Future of Autonomous Ops Starts Here

## Welcome to the Future of Drone Autonomy!

DJI Dock 3 isn’t just another product update—it’s a revolutionary step forward. While the integration changes with FlytBase are minimal, the launch of DJI Dock 3 represents a pivotal evolution in how enterprises deploy and manage drone operations.

## What's New in the Dock 3

* **Improved Durability & Environmental Resilience:**\
  Dock 3 sports an upgraded IP56 rating (vs. IP55) and an expanded operating range from –30°C to 50°C, along with anti-icing propellers for reliable performance in extreme conditions.
* **Vehicle-Mounted & Dual-Dock Deployment:**\
  Unlike Dock 2’s fixed-location setup, Dock 3 supports mounting on vehicles—including the option for dual-dock configurations—enabling on-the-go, mobile operations and continuous drone rotation.
* **Faster Charging & Extended Flight Times:**\
  With a quicker charging cycle (15% to 95% in 27 minutes compared to 32 minutes on Dock 2) and support for drones that offer up to 54 minutes of flight time (versus 50 minutes), Dock 3 minimizes downtime and boosts operational efficiency.
* **Expanded Accessory Ecosystem:**\
  Dock 3 is compatible with new accessories like the D-RTK 3 Relay, gimbal-following spotlight, real-time voice speaker, and obstacle sensing modules, further elevating mission versatility and safety.
