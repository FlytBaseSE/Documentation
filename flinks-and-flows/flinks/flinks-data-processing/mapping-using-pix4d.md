# Mapping Using Pix4D

Mapping Flinks enables you to seamlessly transfer data collected during FlytBase missions to Pix4D plaform, empowering you to create detailed 3D maps for various use cases.

{% hint style="info" %}
You would require the enterprise licence for Pix4D and access to the API key on the FlytBase Platform before you can start using these workflows.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Setting up your Pix4D Flink

* Navigate to the **Operations Dashboard** and click on the Hamburger menu. From the dropdown menu, select  <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (536).png" alt="" data-size="line">**Flinks** under Integrations.

* Start by linking the API key associated with your Pix4D account to FlytBase using the **Link** button.

* Any exports that are made using the FlytBase Platform would be visible under the **Export logs**. Here you would be able to see the status of the models created.

## Transferring data from FlytBase to the Pix4D Flink

* Start by selecting your mission media files once they are available. Then select the export media option

* While exporting, set a name for the export and determine its validity in the Export Manager. The platform will create the media export for you to view in the export manager.

* After the export is complete, you'll have the option to share it directly with your Pix4D Flink.

* Select the Pix4D Flink and choose the site you want it to be a part of.&#x20;
* Click Share. The files will then be transferred to Pix4D where you'll be able to view and process the models.
* Additionally by accessing the Pix4D icon on the **Integrations Panel** present on the right hand side, you can track the progress of the creation of your models.

* Once the media has completed processing you can click on the **view model** option which would open an external link of your processed Pix4D model.
