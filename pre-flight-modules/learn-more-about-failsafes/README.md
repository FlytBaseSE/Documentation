# Learn More About Failsafes

FlytBase does not have any custom failsafes at this time since DJI does not allow access to its cloud APIs for the same. Instead, the DJI Dock and Drone initiate a 'Return to Home' (RTH) or other failsafe protocol as outlined by DJI.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
'Return to Home' (RTH) is referred to as 'Return to Docking Station' (RTDS) in FlytBase.
{% endhint %}

For more detailed information regarding the behavior during these cases, please consult the [DJI User Manual](https://dl.djicdn.com/downloads/m30_series_dock_bundle/UM/20230824/M30_Series_Dock_Bundle_User_Manual_v1.4_1EN.pdf), specifically on pages 41-47.
